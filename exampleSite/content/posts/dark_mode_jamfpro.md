## Darkmode with Arc

First you need to download Arc! Download it [here](https://arc.net)

Arc had a great feature called [Boosts](https://arc.net/boosts)

>*Boosts are a new way to edit and remix your internet, and share it with friends. Boosts are created inside*

Once you have installed **Arc** make sure to setup your new browser. It may look a little different but there are a lot of cool features that you can make use of!

Navigate over to your Jamf Pro 11 instance. Hover over the URL bar to reveal the 'Site Controls' icon and click on it. Initiate New Boost: From the menu that appears, click on the 'New Boost' (Paintbrush) icon.

- Click on the lightblub image to enable dark mode (A).
- Select a colour that you would like to use, I settled on a blue tone (B).
- Using the following controls you can adjust these sliders to get darker and more of a dark mode feel (1,2,3).

## In conclusion

So an easy dark mode for Jamf Pro 11. Once you have set this up you can create different accented colors boosts for each of your Jamf Pro instances. I have a couple instances of Jamf Pro, I have created a custom boost for each Jamf Pro server that I visit.

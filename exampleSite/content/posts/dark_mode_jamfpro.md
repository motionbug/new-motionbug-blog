## Darkmode with Arc

First you need to download Arc! Download it [here](https://arc.net)

Arc had a great feature called [Boosts](https://arc.net/boosts)

>*Boosts are a new way to edit and remix your internet, and share it with friends. Boosts are created inside*

Once you have installed **Arc** make sure to setup your new browser. It may look a little different but there are a lot of cool features that you can make use of!
